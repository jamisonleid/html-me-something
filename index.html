            <h1> My 2 &cent; </h1>
            <p>All in all though, I am grateful to my mentors and family for helping me
                    become who I am today, and I hope I can give back to the world that gave
                    so much to me. </p>

            <p id="beer"> I'm at a bar, writing code to show that I know how to do CSS, so I am going to talk about beer in the next paragraph.</p>

            <p class="ipa"> IPAs can be good beers, but for the most part, they are awful. They taste too bitter, cannot be drank with food, and have essentially become a pissing contest between microbreweries over who can make the most undrinkable beer. I hate IPAs.</p>
